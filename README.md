<h1>About Akshita!</h1>

<p> I am a freshman at St. Louis University! I am from Denver Colorado, which is a 12 hour drive away. I am majoring in data science on the pre-med track, and I hope to be a pediatrician in the future. My favorite color is pink and I love to read, cook, bake, and sing. This is my first computer science class ever but I'm super excited to learn how to code.</p>
<p> My repo contains my homework and notes for the class csci_1070. I git pulled and cloned my homework from week one and two, along with the class repos and put it into my own repository. </p>
